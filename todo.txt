TODO(Ian):

* Find what's causing the execution stalls
* 8/30/2017 I've commented out every line in the parameter map generators that includes
    a number. I think some implicit string concatenation from either SimpleElastix or
    scikit-learn might be the issue.

TODO(Ian):

* Refactor and rename AmsafImageFilter methods. Execute should be Optimize, etc.
